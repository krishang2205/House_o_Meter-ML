# 🏠 House_O_Meter

## 📋 Project Overview

**House_O_Meter** is a machine learning-based solution for predicting real estate prices with precision and speed. By analyzing property attributes like location, size, number of bedrooms, and historical market trends, it provides valuable insights for stakeholders such as buyers, sellers, investors, and developers. The project employs advanced models, including **XGBoost** 🎯, which achieved the best results in terms of accuracy and reliability.

   - ✅ Imputed missing values with statistical techniques.
   - 🚫 Removed outliers to prevent skewed predictions.
   - 📏 Scaled and transformed features for model readiness.

### 2. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Key Insights**:
     - 📈 Strong positive correlation between property size and price.
     - 📍 Location plays a significant role in price variations.
     - 🛏️ Properties with more bedrooms generally command higher prices.
   - **Visualizations**:
     - 🗺️ **Heatmaps** to highlight feature correlations.
     - 📏 **Scatter Plots** for trends like price vs. size.
     - 📦 **Box Plots** for distribution and outlier analysis.
     - 🏗️ **Pie Charts** for categorical distributions (e.g., property availability).
     - 🏙️ **Bar Charts** comparing prices by location and area type.

### 3. 🤖 **Model Implementation**
   - **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for comparison.
   - **Lasso Regression**: Feature selection through L1 regularization.
   - **Ridge Regression**: Robust performance with L2 regularization.
   - **XGBoost**: Best performer for handling nonlinear relationships and complex datasets.
